Casinos use our proprietary products and services to enhance their gaming operations and improve their profitability, productivity and security, as well as to offer popular cutting-edge gaming entertainment content and technology to their players. We market our products and services to online casinos worldwide and to land-based casino gaming companies in North America, the Caribbean, Central America, the United Kingdom, Europe and Africa and to cruise ship companies. We license our products and services for use solely in legalized gaming markets. We also license our content and distribute content from other companies to iGaming operators throughout the world.\n",

            "Proprietary Table Games. Casinos use Proprietary Table Games together with or in lieu of other games in the public domain (e.g. Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, etc.) because of their popularity with players and to increase profitability. Typically, Proprietary Table Games are grouped into two product types referred to as “Side Bets” and “Premium Games.” Side Bets are proprietary features and wagering options typically added to public domain games such as baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games. Examples of our Side Bets include 21+3®, Lucky Ladies® and Bonus Craps™. Premium Games are unique stand-alone games with their own set of rules and strategies. Examples of our Premium Games include Heads Up Hold ’em®, High Card Flush®, Cajun Stud® and Three Card Poker®. Generally, Premium Games generate higher revenue per table placement than the Side Bet games.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enhanced Table Systems. Enhanced Table Systems are electronic enhancements used on casino table games to add to player appeal and to enhance game security. An example in this category is our Bonus Jackpot System (“BJS”), an advanced electronic system installed on gaming tables designed to collect data by detecting player wagers and other game activities. This information is processed and used to improve casino operations by evaluating game play, to improve dealer efficiency and to reward players through the offering of jackpots and other bonusing mechanisms. Typically, the BJS system includes an electronic video display, known as TableVision, which shows game information designed to generate player interest and to promote various aspects of the game. The BJS system can also be used to network numerous gaming tables together into a common system either within a casino or through the interconnection of multiple casinos, which we refer to as our Inter-Casino Link System. In 2022, we plan to introduce a new table system called Triton™. Triton is designed to be a platform on which we can build a suite of enhanced table game features and services, the first of which will be the progressive jackpot wagers currently provided by BJS. Triton is built using off-the-shelf electronic components and software in order to minimize field service issues.\n",

            "iGaming. On August 21, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the member interests in Progressive Games Partners, LLC (“PGP”). PGP holds the exclusive worldwide rights to a number of games titles (including ours) for relicensing to operators of online gaming systems principally in Europe, the United Kingdom, and, more recently, the United States. Prior to the acquisition, PGP had been the exclusive distributor of our games to the online gaming sector; by making the acquisition of PGP, we effectively eliminated the distributor fee that PGP charged us, and we now also receive the revenue PGP earns on the content of other licensors (to whom we pay a royalty fee). In many cases, these online operators provide “white label” gaming infrastructure for many separate online casino brands with the result that the content that PGP licenses can appear on hundreds of online gaming sites. PGP’s contracts with online operators prohibit those operators from deploying the content in markets where it is not legal to do so.\n",

            "Product Strategy. In the physical casino market, we have a “three-dimensional” growth strategy. First, we seek to increase the number of casinos we serve with our games. Second, within a casino, we seek to increase the number of tables on which we have placements. Our current product placements are concentrated around blackjack, and we have developed side bets and other game content to address other table game categories such as baccarat, roulette and craps. Finally, by adding our enhanced systems to tables that already have our content, we can increase the billable units per table. For example, on a blackjack table that has one of our side bets we can add a second side bet and a progressive jackpot for each side bet thereby increasing the billable units for that table from one to four. As of December 31, 2021, we served 515 casinos worldwide, had content on 4,500 tables in those casinos and had a total of 6,709 billable units in those casinos.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our strategy in iGaming is similar in that it seeks to have our content on as many online tables as possible. However, the structure of the iGaming business is different in that many of our customers are iGaming platform providers that offer a turnkey online gaming solution to online operators who deploy those online offerings directly to the gaming player. To a lesser extent, we license our content to online operators who have their own platform and serve gaming customers directly. The online analog to a casino is called a “skin”\n"

            "Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io.\n",

A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the manual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re- cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame- works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA, and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes, and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not documented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in reinventing the DIA wheel.\n",
